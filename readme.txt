This repository contains the visual studio implementation of a lookback pricer in C++ and the user interface in VBA. 

Please note that this project works only on 64bits windows devices. 

Before testing the program: 

Make sure to update the paths in the VBA code of the user interface.

The user interface is accessible by opening the excel in: C++\lookback\x64

Do not remove the images from the folder 

Then in Excel, select Developer => Visual Basic => Right click on ModernUserForm and select code

The Lib (dll C++) directory must be changed by adding the correct path to the C++ folder

"path_to_C++_folder\C++\lookback\x64\Debug\lookback.dll"
